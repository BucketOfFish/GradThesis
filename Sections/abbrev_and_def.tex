\chapter*{List of Abbreviations and Definitions}

\begin{symbollist*}
\item[ATLAS] A Toroidal LHC ApparatuS. A detector at the LHC.
\item[CERN] Conseil Européen pour la Recherche Nucléaire. A multinational high-energy physics experiment operating on the French-Swiss border.
\item[FTk] Fast TracKer. A hardware-based track reconstructor which is part of the ATLAS trigger system.
\item[LHC] Large Hadron Collider. A circular proton-proton collider operating at CERN.
\item[MC] Monte Carlo. A class of algorithms based on random sampling. In high-energy physics, MC events (as opposed to data) are simulated via MC algorithms, rather than gathered from actual collisions.
\item[model] A set of equations describing how physics behaves in a certain regime. e.g. the Standard Model.
\item[RNN] Recurrent neural net. A neural architecture described in Section~\ref{sec:RNN}.
\item[search] An attempt to find evidence that collision data is better described by an alternative model than by the Standard Model. e.g. SUSY search.
\item[SM] Standard Model. This model describes how the elemagnetic, weak, and strong forces interact with all known elementary particles, and is described in Chapter~\ref{chap:SM}.
\item[SUSY] Supersymmetry. A class of models described in Chapter~\ref{chap:SUSY}.
