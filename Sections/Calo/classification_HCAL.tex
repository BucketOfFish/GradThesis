\chapter{Use of HCAL in Classification}\label{app:classification_HCAL}

Since the GoogLeNet architecture was quite large and required significant memory usage and computational power, we decided to investigate the possibility of leaving out HCAL cell-level information, since most of the particle shower occurs in the ECAL. Using our best-performing DNN architecture, we ran ten training sessions with HCAL information, and ten training sessions without HCAL. Averaged training curves from these runs are shown in Figures~\ref{fig:HCAL_study_elechpi} and~\ref{fig:HCAL_study_gammapi0}. These studies demonstrated that including the HCAL caused little to no improvement in classification accuracy. For memory purposes, we thus kept HCAL cell-level information out of our GN architecture. Summed HCAL energy was still fed as an input to the combined classification-regression net, for use in energy regression.

We must note here that though HCAL information is useful for particle reconstruction in general, the reason we do not see much use for it here is because we are mostly looking at events where the majority of energy is deposited in the ECAL. This is particularly true due to the HCAL/ECAL ratio we have applied to electron/charged pion events.
