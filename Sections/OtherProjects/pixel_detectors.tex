\chapter{Pixel Detectors}

I also performed some work on upgrades to the ITk for the ATLAS Phase-II upgrade. Recently I spent a year at Argonne under the guidance of Dr. Jessica Metcalfe working on manufacturing methods for mass production of silicon pixel detectors in preparation for the upgrade. During that time I worked on setting up a manufacturing lab and various electronic test environments, on assembling pixel modules using various mechanical epoxy-based techniques, on designing adapter boards for readout electronics, and on performing tests on assembled modules. I also participated in a three-month testbeam at Fermilab with the University of Geneva, during which we gathered and analyzed data from a proposed HVCMOS pixel detector. The idea behind this detector was that due to advances in silicon sensor manufacturing, we could build readout circuitry directly into the detector, removing the need for an external readout chip. This resulted in less detector material, and also reduced manufacturing cost. I presented results from this testbeam at DPF 2017 \cite{DPF}, and this analysis, combined with additional data taken by the University of Geneva at the SPS in CERN, will be presented in an upcoming paper on the new detector.
